                <p id="about-text">East Asian skincare has grown into a billion dollar industry for its high-quality, 
                    low cost products compared to North American retails like Sephora. 
                    Due to East Asia's beauty industry being a pioneer in skincare research and 
                    advanced technology, it has led to many brands being able to provide a diverse range of affordable products 
                    for people of all ages and skin types. 
                    There is a growing popularity in North America; however, these products are not available in store here 
                    so this service can allow people to purchase products from different brands and only pay for shipping once.</p>
