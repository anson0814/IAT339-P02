            <p id="about-text">East Asian skincare has grown into a billion dollar industry for its high-quality, 
                low cost products compared to North American retails like Sephora. 
                Due to East Asia's beauty industry being a pioneer in skincare research and 
                advanced technology, it has led to many brands being able to provide a diverse range of affordable products 
                for people of all ages and skin types. 
                There is a growing popularity in North America; however, these products are not available in store here 
                so this service can allow people to purchase products from different brands and only pay for shipping once.</p>
